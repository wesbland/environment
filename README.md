environment
===========

My environment settings directory. Feel free to clone / fork / modify as it is helpful to you.

* On my system, everything lives in a directory under $HOME called .dotfiles.
* You can then run setup.sh that will setup all of the symlinks automatically.
* The bashrc file is probably more specific to my machine than will be
  useful for most people, but might be able to glean some useful information
  there.
* The vimrc does assume that you use pathogen to manage plugins and that is
  setup in the vim/ directory.
